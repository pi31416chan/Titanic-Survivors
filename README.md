This is a competition held on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)\
Train and Test dataset are provided, where only the train data set contains labels.

## Models Involved
* SVC
* Linear SVC
* SGD Classifier
* Ridge Classifier
* Decision Tree Classifier
* K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest Classifier

## Conclusion
The best model so far I have explored with Grid Search is Random Forest Classifier.
Submission on Kaggle yields 0.78468 points.
